## Documentation of the Alien Signal Database and Analysis Framework

This document outlines the structure of the "alien" database and describes key concepts, metrics, and classification systems used for identifying and analyzing potential extraterrestrial signals. The database tracks observational data from various observatories and telescopes, captures detailed characteristics of detected signals, records the analysis and decoding processes, stores information about potential source locations, and manages the research workflow.

### Observational Environment and Conditions

Observations are conducted by various **Observatories**, each uniquely identified by its **Observatory Name**. The **Observatories** table records atmospheric and environmental conditions at the time of observation, including **Weather Profile** (e.g., Clear, Cloudy), **Seeing Profile** (e.g., Good, Poor), **Atmospheric Transparency** (a numeric measure), **Lunar Phase**, **Moon Distance (Degrees)**, **Solar Activity**, **Geomagnetic Activity**, **Local Sidereal Time**, **Air Temperature (°C)**, **Humidity (\%)**, **Wind Speed (m/s)**, and **Pressure (hPa)**.

**Telescopes**, identified by **Telescope Registry** codes, are linked to specific observatories via the **Observatory Name Reference**. The **Telescopes** table tracks the operational status of the equipment, including **Equipment Status** (e.g., Operational, Degraded), **Calibration Status** (e.g., Current, Due), pointing and tracking accuracies (**Pointing Accuracy (arcsec)**, **Tracking Accuracy (arcsec)**), **Focus Quality**, **Detector Temperature (K)**, **Cooling System Status**, **Power Supply Status**, **Data Storage Status**, **Network Status**, **Bandwidth Usage (\%)**, and **Processing Queue Status**.

The **Observational Conditions** table provides detailed context for specific signal observations, including the **Observation Time**, **Observation Date**, and **Observation Duration (hours)** linked to a signal via its **Signal Registry Reference**.

Several metrics are used to quantify the quality and characteristics of the observing environment:

*   **Atmospheric Observability Index (AOI):** This index quantifies how suitable atmospheric conditions are for signal detection. It is calculated as the product of **Atmospheric Transparency**, a factor based on **Humidity (\%)** (where higher humidity reduces the factor), and a factor based on **Wind Speed (m/s)** (where higher wind speed reduces the factor). An AOI value closer to 1 indicates ideal observation conditions.
    *   $AOI = \text{Atmospheric Transparency} \times (1 - \frac{\text{Humidity (\%)}}{100}) \times (1 - 0.02 \times \text{Wind Speed (m/s)})$
*   **Lunar Interference Factor (LIF):** This factor estimates potential interference from lunar illumination. Higher values indicate more lunar interference, with values above 0.5 suggesting significant contamination. It is calculated based on the **Moon Distance (Degrees)** (closer moon increases interference) and **Atmospheric Transparency** (less transparency can reduce lunar light scatter).
    *   $LIF = (1 - \frac{\text{Moon Distance (Degrees)}}{180}) \times (1 - \text{Atmospheric Transparency})$
*   **Detection Instrument Sensitivity Factor (DISF):** This metric assesses the effective sensitivity of the detection setup considering atmospheric and lunar conditions. It combines factors related to **Air Temperature (°C)** (deviation from 15°C reduces sensitivity), **Atmospheric Transparency**, **Humidity (\%)**, and **Moon Distance (Degrees)**. Values closer to 10 indicate optimal sensitivity.
    *   $DISF = (10 - \frac{|\text{Air Temperature (°C)} - 15|}{10}) \times \text{Atmospheric Transparency} \times (1 - \frac{\text{Humidity (\%)}}{200}) \times \frac{100 - \text{Moon Distance (Degrees)}}{100}$
*   **Observation Quality Factor (OQF):** A comprehensive measure combining atmospheric and lunar factors with telescope **Pointing Accuracy (arcsec)**. If **Pointing Accuracy (arcsec)** is 2 arcseconds or less, a factor of 1 is used; otherwise, a factor is calculated based on the inverse of the accuracy.
    *   $OQF = \text{AOI} \times (1 - \text{LIF}) \times (\text{if Pointing Accuracy (arcsec)} \leq 2 \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } \frac{2}{\text{Pointing Accuracy (arcsec)}})$

Specific conditions related to observations are also defined:

*   **Optimal Observing Window (OOW):** Conditions considered ideal for observations. This occurs when the **Atmospheric Observability Index (AOI)** is above 0.85, the **Lunar Phase** is either 'New' or 'First Quarter', the **Moon Distance (Degrees)** is greater than 45, and the **Solar Activity** is 'Low' or 'Moderate'.
*   **Signal Degradation Scenario (SDS):** Conditions that compromise signal quality due to environmental factors. This includes situations where **Atmospheric Transparency** is less than 0.7, **Humidity (\%)** is greater than 70, **Wind Speed (m/s)** is greater than 8, or **Geomagnetic Activity** is a 'Storm'.
*   **Observational Confidence Level (OCL):** A tiered system rating observation reliability based on conditions and equipment. 'High' confidence requires AOI > 0.8, **Equipment Status** 'Operational', and **Calibration Status** 'Current'. 'Medium' confidence applies to AOI between 0.5 and 0.8 or minor equipment issues. 'Low' confidence results from AOI < 0.5 or significant equipment problems.
*   **High Lunar Interference Events:** Observations where the calculated **Lunar Interference Factor (LIF)** is greater than 0.5, indicating strong contamination from moonlight.
*   **Equipment Problems:** Defined as any instance where a telescope's key subsystem is not in its nominal state: **Equipment Status** is not 'Operational', **Calibration Status** is not 'Current', or **Cooling System Status** is not 'Normal'.

### Signal Characteristics and Dynamics

The core of the database is the **Signals** table, which uniquely identifies each detected signal via a **Signal Registry**. This table captures numerous characteristics, including **Timestamp**, the **Telescope Reference** used, **Detection Instrument**, broad **Signal Type** (e.g., Narrowband, Broadband), **Signal Strength (dB)**, **Frequency (MHz)**, **Bandwidth (Hz)**, **Center Frequency (MHz)**, **Frequency Drift (Hz/s)**, **Doppler Shift (Hz)**, **Signal Duration (s)**, **Pulse Rate (pulses/sec)**, **Pulse Width (ms)**, **Modulation Type**, **Modulation Index**, **Carrier Frequency (MHz)**, **Phase Shift (°)**, **Polarization Mode**, **Polarization Angle (°)**, **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**, **Noise Floor (dBm)**, **Interference Level**, **RFI Status**, and **Atmospheric Interference**.

The **Signal Dynamics** table, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**, provides further details on how the signal behaves over time and space. This includes **Signal Integrity**, **Signal Recurrence** (e.g., Regular, Sporadic), **Signal Evolution** (e.g., Dynamic, Static), temporal, spatial, frequency, phase, amplitude, and modulation stabilities (**Temporal Stability**, **Spatial Stability**, **Frequency Stability**, **Phase Stability**, **Amplitude Stability**, **Modulation Stability**), **Signal Coherence**, **Signal Dispersion**, and **Signal Scintillation**. (Note: Data for this table may not be fully populated yet).

Several calculated metrics capture aspects of signal behavior and quality:

*   **Bandwidth-Frequency Ratio (BFR):** This ratio helps characterize the spectral spread of a signal. It's calculated by dividing the **Bandwidth (Hz)** by the **Center Frequency (MHz)** converted to Hertz. Narrow ratios (e.g., < 0.001) can indicate technological signals, while wider ratios suggest natural phenomena.
    *   $BFR = \frac{\text{Bandwidth (Hz)}}{\text{Center Frequency (MHz)} \times 1,000,000}$
    Specific illustrations relate to BFR:
    *   **Signal Type: Narrowband:** Describes signals with a very low BFR (typically < 0.0001), often associated with technological origins.
    *   **Signal Class: Broadband Transient:** Describes signals that are short in duration (typically < 5 seconds) and have a wide BFR (> 0.1).
*   **Signal Stability Metric (SSM):** Quantifies overall temporal and spectral stability. Higher SSM values suggest more stable signals. It considers the **Frequency Drift (Hz/s)** relative to the **Frequency (MHz)** and the **Signal Duration (s)** modified by the **Doppler Shift (Hz)**.
    *   $SSM = (1 - \frac{|\text{Frequency Drift (Hz/s)}|}{\text{Frequency (MHz)} \times 1000}) \times \frac{\text{Signal Duration (s)}}{1 + \frac{\text{Doppler Shift (Hz)}}{1000}}$
*   **Signal-to-Noise Quality Indicator (SNQI):** A unified metric for signal detection quality, combining **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** and **Noise Floor (dBm)**. Higher values indicate better quality. Positive SNQI values generally mean the signal is **Analyzable** and useful for further study.
    *   $SNQI = \text{Signal-to-Noise Ratio} - 0.1 \times |\text{Noise Floor (dBm)}|$
*   **Modulation Complexity Score (MCS):** Evaluates the sophistication of signal modulation, combining **Modulation Index** and the **Signal Stability Metric (SSM)**, with additional weighting based on the **Modulation Type** (AM gets a factor of 2, FM gets 1.5, others get 1). Higher scores suggest more complex, potentially artificial, modulation.
    *   $MCS = \text{Modulation Index} \times (1 + \text{SSM}) \times M_{factor}$ (where $M_{factor}$ is 2 for AM, 1.5 for FM, 1 otherwise)
*   **PolarMode: Circular:** An illustration of a specific polarization type. Circular polarization maintaining high purity is rare naturally and might indicate technological origin.

### Signal Analysis and Interpretation

The **Signal Probabilities** table, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**, provides probabilistic assessments for each signal, including **False Positive Probability**, **Signal Uniqueness**, **Similarity Index** (compared to known signals), **Correlation Score**, **Anomaly Score** (how unusual it is), **Technosignature Probability**, **Biosignature Probability**, **Natural Source Probability**, and **Artificial Source Probability**. Specific low **False Positive Probability** values (e.g., < 0.01) indicate extremely high confidence in the detection itself.

The **Signal Classification** table assigns high-level categories and structural properties, including **Classification Type** (e.g., Artificial, Natural, Candidate), **Signal Pattern** (e.g., Periodic, Random, Structured), **Repetition Count**, **Period (s)**, **Complexity Index**, **Entropy**, **Information Density**, and **Classification Confidence (\%)**.

Calculated metrics and domain definitions support the analysis and interpretation of signals:

*   **Signal Complexity Ratio (SCR):** Measures the relationship between **Complexity Index** and **Information Density**, normalized by the logarithm of the **Bandwidth (Hz)**. Higher values may suggest an artificial origin.
    *   $SCR = \frac{\text{Complexity Index} \times \text{Information Density}}{\log(\text{Bandwidth (Hz)})}$
*   **Information Entropy Ratio (IER):** Compares the signal's **Entropy** to an expected natural baseline derived from **Natural Source Probability**. Values significantly greater than 1 suggest non-natural information content.
    *   $IER = \frac{\text{Entropy}}{\text{Natural Source Probability} \times 0.9 + 0.1}$
*   **Pattern Recognition Confidence (PRC):** Measures confidence in identified patterns, weighting **Repetition Count** (if > 1), **Entropy** (lower entropy suggests more structure), and the **Signal Complexity Ratio (SCR)**.
    *   $PRC = (\text{if Repetition Count} > 1 \text{ then } 1 + \log_{10}(\text{Repetition Count}) \text{ else } 0.5) \times (\text{if Entropy} < 0.9 \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } 0.3) \times \text{SCR}$
*   **Technological Origin Likelihood Score (TOLS):** Estimates the probability of a technological origin by combining **Technosignature Probability**, the inverse of **Natural Source Probability**, **Signal Uniqueness**, and a factor based on **Anomaly Score**. Values above 0.75 warrant further investigation. Signals are categorized by **TOLS Category** as 'Low' (< 0.25), 'Medium' (< 0.75), or 'High' (>= 0.75).
    *   $TOLS = \text{Technosignature Probability} \times (1 - \text{Natural Source Probability}) \times \text{Signal Uniqueness} \times (0.5 + \frac{\text{Anomaly Score}}{10})$
*   **Artificial Intelligence Detection Probability (AIDP):** Calculates the likelihood of origin from artificial intelligence, weighting the **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI)** and **Technological Origin Likelihood Score (TOLS)** against the **Natural Source Probability**.
    *   $AIDP = \frac{\text{ECI} \times \text{TOLS}}{1 + \text{Natural Source Probability}}$
*   **Technosignature:** Defined as a signal with **Technosignature Probability** > 0.7, **Natural Source Probability** < 0.3, **Artificial Source Probability** < 50 (likely a typo in original KB, assuming < 50\% or a different scale), that exhibits a narrow **Bandwidth-Frequency Ratio (BFR)** (< 0.001) and high **Information Density** (> 0.8).
*   **Potential Biosignature:** Defined as a signal with **Biosignature Probability** > 0.6, **Technosignature Probability** < 0.4, and spectral features matching known biological emission patterns.
*   **Coherent Information Pattern (CIP):** Characterizes signals suggesting deliberate information transmission based on high **Signal Stability Metric (SSM)** (> 0.8), **Entropy** between 0.4-0.8 (indicating structure, not randomness), and consistent **Modulation Index** (> 0.5). A **CIP Classification Label** system categorizes signals as 'Coherent Information Pattern Detected', 'Potential Information Pattern', or 'No Clear Pattern' based on specific thresholds of SSM and Entropy, plus **Modulation Index** for the highest category.
*   **Narrowband Technological Marker (NTM):** A specific signature for technological transmission defined by extremely narrow **Bandwidth-Frequency Ratio (BFR)** (< 0.0001) and very low **Frequency Drift (Hz/s)** (< 0.1). A **NTM Classification System** provides 'Strong NTM' (stricter BFR/Drift and non-natural modulation), 'Moderate NTM' (slightly relaxed BFR/Drift and non-natural modulation), or 'Not NTM'.
*   **Fast Radio Transient (FRT):** Defined as signals with extremely short **Signal Duration (s)** (< 0.1), high **Signal Strength (dB)** (> 15), broad **Bandwidth (Hz)** (> 1,000,000), and no repetition (**Repetition Count** = 1).

### Signal Decoding and Verification

The **Signal Decoding** table tracks the process of attempting to extract meaningful information from a signal, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**. It includes details like **Encoding Type** (e.g., Binary, Unknown), **Compression Ratio**, **Error Correction Level**, **Decoding Confidence (\%)**, **Decoding Method** (e.g., FFT, Wavelet), **Decoding Status** (e.g., Completed, In Progress), **Decoding Iterations**, **Processing Time (hours)**, **Computational Resources** used, **Analysis Depth**, **Verification Level**, and **Confirmation Status**. Illustrations include **EncryptEvid: Strong Pattern** (evidence suggesting designed encoding resisting simple methods) and **EncodeType: Frequency Hopping** (a sophisticated encoding technique).

Key metrics and definitions related to decoding and verification:

*   **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI):** Evaluates the sophistication of potential encoding based on **Compression Ratio**, **Complexity Index**, and **Entropy**. Values above 1.5 suggest deliberate encoding.
    *   $ECI = \frac{\text{Compression Ratio} \times \text{Complexity Index} \times \text{Entropy}}{10}$
*   **Signal Processing Efficiency Index (SPEI):** Evaluates how efficiently computational resources were used relative to signal complexity. It's calculated based on **Decoding Iterations**, **Processing Time (hours)**, **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI)**, and **Complexity Index**.
    *   $SPEI = \frac{\text{Decoding Iterations} \times \text{Processing Time (hours)}}{\text{ECI} \times \text{Complexity Index}}$
*   **Confirmation Confidence Score (CCS):** Quantifies overall confidence in the verification of a signal. It combines **False Positive Probability**, **Decoding Confidence (\%)**, **Classification Confidence (\%)**, and a factor based on the **Signal-to-Noise Quality Indicator (SNQI)**. Higher SNQI values contribute to higher CCS. Signals with **CCS** > 0.8 are considered **High Confidence Signals**. An alternative calculation, **CCS Approximation**, is available if SNQI data is limited, using raw **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** and **Noise Floor (dBm)** values directly.
    *   $CCS = (1 - \text{False Positive Probability}) \times \text{Decoding Confidence (\%)} \times \text{Classification Confidence (\%)} \times (\text{if SNQI} > 0 \text{ then } \frac{\text{SNQI}}{10} + 0.5 \text{ else } 0.1)$
    *   $CCS Approximation = (1 - \text{False Positive Probability}) \times \text{Decoding Confidence (\%)} \times (\text{if Signal-to-Noise Ratio} - 0.1 \times |\text{Noise Floor (dBm)}| > 0 \text{ then } \frac{\text{Signal-to-Noise Ratio} - 0.1 \times |\text{Noise Floor (dBm)}|}{10} + 0.5 \text{ else } 0.1)$
*   **Encoded Information Transfer (EIT):** Characterizes signals that appear to contain deliberate encoding. Criteria include **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI)** > 1.8, **Entropy** between 0.3-0.7 (structured, not random), and consistent internal patterns suggesting language or data schemes.
*   **Observation-Verified Signal:** Defined as a signal observed under **Optimal Observing Window (OOW)** conditions with an **Observation Quality Factor (OQF)** > 0.85 and a **Confirmation Confidence Score (CCS)** > 0.8, indicating high-quality observation and verification.

### Source Properties and Significance

The **Source Properties** table, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**, captures information about the celestial origin of the signal. This includes **Right Ascension (°)** and **Declination (°)**, estimated **Distance (ly)**, **Galactic Longitude (°) **and **Galactic Latitude (°)**. Properties of the celestial object are also recorded: broad **Celestial Object** type (e.g., Star, Galaxy), more specific **Object Subtype** (e.g., Dwarf, Giant), **Apparent Magnitude**, **Object Temperature (K)**, **Object Mass (solar)**, **Object Age (Gyr)**, **Metallicity**, **Proper Motion (mas/yr)**, and **Radial Velocity (km/s)**. (Note: Data for this table may not be fully populated yet).

Metrics related to source location and characteristics are calculated:

*   **Celestial Location Significance Factor (CLSF):** Calculates the significance of the source location based on the **Celestial Object** type (objects are weighted higher), specific **Object Subtype** (Giants with solar-like mass get extra weight), and **Metallicity** (higher metallicity increases significance). Higher values indicate source locations potentially more likely to harbor intelligent life.
    *   $CLSF = (\text{if Celestial Object is not null then 2 else 1}) \times (\text{if Object Subtype = 'Giant' AND Object Mass (solar) between 0.8 and 1.2 then 1.5 else 1}) \times (\text{if Metallicity > 0 then Metallicity + 1 else 0.5})$
*   **Habitable Zone Signal Relevance (HZSR):** Assesses relevance based on the source's potential position within a habitable zone. It weights the **Technological Origin Likelihood Score (TOLS)** by factors specific to dwarf stars (checking if **Object Mass (solar)** is within a suitable range and if the estimated **Distance (ly)** relative to mass is within a typical habitable zone scale).
    *   $HZSR = \text{TOLS} \times (\text{if Object Subtype = 'Dwarf' then } (\text{if } 0.7 \leq \text{Object Mass (solar)} \leq 1.4 \text{ then } (\text{if } 0.8 \leq \frac{\text{Distance (ly)}}{\sqrt{\text{Object Mass (solar)}}} \leq 1.7 \text{ then } 2 \text{ else } 0.5) \text{ else } 0.3) \text{ else } 0.1)$
*   **Habitable Zone Transmission:** Defined as a signal with **Habitable Zone Signal Relevance (HZSR)** > 1.5 and exhibiting **Technosignature** characteristics, originating from a star system potentially suitable for life.
*   **Signal of Galactic Significance:** Classifies signals potentially important for understanding galactic civilizations. These signals originate from regions with a high **Celestial Location Significance Factor (CLSF)** (> 2.0), display **Technosignature** characteristics, and have a high **Artificial Intelligence Detection Probability (AIDP)** (> 0.7).

### Advanced Phenomena and Research Process

The **Signal Advanced Phenomena** table, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**, captures observations of less common or potentially significant attributes. These include **Interstellar Medium Effects**, evidence of **Gravitational Lensing**, observed **Quantum Effects** (e.g., Significant, Observed), **Encryption Evidence** (e.g., Strong, Possible), **Language Structure** (e.g., Complex, Simple), inferred **Message Content** (e.g., Identified, Possible), and assessments of **Cultural Significance** and **Scientific Impact**.

Domain knowledge definitions link advanced phenomena to other metrics:

*   **Quantum-Coherent Transmission:** Describes signals potentially using quantum properties, indicated by **Quantum Effects** being 'Significant' or 'Observed', unusually high **Information Density** (> 1.5), and a high **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI)** (> 2.5).
*   **Anomalous Quantum Signal:** Characterized by **Quantum Effects** indicating anomaly, a high **Anomaly Score** (> 8), and unusually high **Modulation Complexity Score (MCS)** (> 2.0), suggesting phenomena beyond current understanding.
*   **Directed Transmission:** Identifies signals that appear intentionally aimed, based on moderate **Spatial Stability**, narrow beam characteristics (**Polarization Mode** 'Linear' with stable **Polarization Angle (°)**), and a high **Technological Origin Likelihood Score (TOLS)** (> 0.85).
*   **Multi-Channel Communication Protocol:** Suggested by signals exhibiting **Coherent Information Pattern (CIP)** characteristics across multiple frequencies with coordinated timing (**Repetition Count** > 3, consistent **Period (s)**) and a high **Encoding Complexity Index (ECI)** > 2.0).

The **Research Process** table, linked by **Signal Registry Reference**, manages the workflow for studying detected signals. It tracks **Analysis Priority** (e.g., Urgent, High), **Follow-up Status**, **Peer Review Status**, **Publication Status**, **Research Priority**, **Funding Status**, **Collaboration Status** (e.g., International, Solo), **Security Classification** (e.g., Classified, Public), **Disclosure Status**, and any **Research Notes**.

Prioritization metrics guide the research process:

*   **Research Priority Index (RPI):** Helps prioritize signals for follow-up based on a combination of **Technosignature Probability**, **Biosignature Probability**, **Signal Uniqueness**, **Anomaly Score**, and the inverse of **False Positive Probability**. Higher RPI values indicate higher research priority, with values above 3 considered high priority.
    *   $RPI = (\text{Technosignature Probability} \times 4 + \frac{\text{Biosignature Probability}}{100} + \text{Signal Uniqueness} \times 2 + \frac{\text{Anomaly Score}}{2}) \times (1 - \text{False Positive Probability})$
*   **Target of Opportunity (TOO):** Identifies high-value signals requiring immediate attention. These signals have an **RPI** > 3.5, **Technosignature Probability** > 0.8, and **Anomaly Score** > 5, and have not been explained by known phenomena.
*   **Research Critical Signal:** Defined as signals meeting the **Target of Opportunity (TOO)** criteria that also have high **Pattern Recognition Confidence (PRC)** (> 0.8) and low **Interstellar Medium Effects** (e.g., not 'Severe'), indicating high-quality signals with recognizable patterns warranting maximum research resources.
